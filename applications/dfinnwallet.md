### Overview

   DFINN Wallet emerges as the all-encompassing non-custodial wallet solution catering to Substrate and EVM Blockchains.Riding on the capabilities of Polkadot.js, Dfinn Wallet places a strong emphasis on enriching the user experience and refining the user interface. Our foresight presents the crypto wallet as a portal to the expansive Web3 multiverse, granting users effortless entry to a spectrum of multi-chain services while ensuring the highest echelons of security and user convenience.
Embark on a frictionless journey of connecting with and harnessing the potential of blockchain-based applications within Substrate and EVM blockchains, facilitated seamlessly through our purpose-built Mobile App, accessible on both Android and iOS platforms.

### Background

The project background begins with my solo development effort, drawing inspiration from open-source wallets such as Subwallet, Nova, and Trust Wallet. I bootstrapped the project entirely on my own, including the launch of both iOS and Android apps and conducting initial testing. Now, I aim to elevate this wallet to the next level by incorporating additional features through the hiring of new developers.

### Team's experience

I am Bharath, based in Bangalore, India, and I bring extensive experience as a full-stack blockchain developer. For the past 1.5 years, I have been the sole contributor to the Edgeware blockchain, where I have developed and maintained numerous infrastructure tools. Currently, I am finalizing products that will significantly benefit the entire Polkadot ecosystem, including a cutting-edge block explorer with AI capabilities and the Edgeverse DAO's SCO platform. Additionally, I am the director of two companies in India. My goal is to collaborate with developers in the Substrate ecosystem to create superior products. To this end, I have recently hired a junior React Native developer and plan to expand my team further in the near future.

## Development Roadmap ðŸ”©

### Overview

##### Total Estimated Duration: 2 Months
##### Total Costs:  11500 USD

##### Milestone 1 â€” New Feature Implementation 

- ##### Estimated Duration:- Estimated Duration: -1.5 month
- #####  Costs: 6000

This milestone focuses on implementing basic features within the wallet app. In today's AI-driven era, we can streamline the process of adding these features efficiently. My goal for this milestone is to onboard high-quality developers onto the team. I've already tested some of these features using JavaScript, making it easier for new developers to implement with clear references.

## Future Plans

- In our immediate next proposal, we aim to further enhance the Web3Quest Platform specifically designed for the Substrate ecosystem. Building upon the success and functionalities of platforms like QuestN, Zealy, and TaskON for EVM blockchains, our focus is on creating an interactive "interact and earn" experience that encourages user engagement and participation. The upgraded platform will feature an expanded API for seamless integration with wallets, dApps, forums, and other ecosystem components, offering developers enhanced flexibility and capabilities. Additionally, we will provide an advanced Developer SDK to streamline integration processes and empower developers to create innovative experiences within the Substrate ecosystem. Users will benefit from improved embeddable widgets, quests, challenges, and reward mechanisms, fostering a vibrant and collaborative community within the Substrate ecosystem. This represents our commitment to continuous improvement and innovation, driving user adoption and ecosystem growth.

- We are implementing the MPC Wallet Architecture within Dfinnwallet Cloud, utilizing Multi-Party Computation techniques to bolster security and privacy measures. This framework distributes key operations across multiple parties, eliminating single points of failure. Our approach includes distributed key generation, secure communication channels, threshold signature schemes, decentralized key management, and compliance features. These components collectively ensure robust security, auditability, and resilience against threats, making our platform a trusted solution for securely managing digital assets.

- We are implementing Web3 debit cards within Dfinnwallet Cloud, providing users with streamlined access to decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities. These cutting-edge debit cards seamlessly connect traditional finance and blockchain technology, allowing users to easily manage and spend their digital assets. Leveraging Dfinnwallet Cloud's secure infrastructure, users can experience heightened security, privacy, and convenience while accessing a diverse array of DeFi services directly through their Web3 debit cards.


- Introducing an industry-first Nominee feature tailored for DeFi users. This innovative addition allows users to designate nominees who can access and manage their digital assets in the event of unforeseen circumstances. This feature provides an added layer of security and convenience, ensuring continuity and peace of mind for DeFi participants.



- Our upcoming plan includes the development of a groundbreaking blockchain smartphone featuring an OS-level wallet. This innovative device will seamlessly integrate blockchain technology into its operating system, offering users secure and convenient access to digital assets directly from their smartphone.
